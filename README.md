## Project idea summary

the ideé of the project is to bring gamers updates about there favorite games all in one website.
The website is about to bring all relevant content about the game that a gamer that plays that game want to know. For examples events, shops, skins and so on. Why this is needed is becoues the people that are playing a game much might want to regulary check what event & cosmetics that are coming out on a dayly basis or weekly basis.

## Background

My target audience are guys between the ages of 12-25 becoues thats usally the sex and age that are gaming the most. Ofcourse there is some other sub audiance also but in the styling and how i build the website i will meet the expectations of my main audiance.
Since I also am gamer I felt like a website like this was missing. Becoues most of the time i want to know whats happening in the game im playing atm. And also most of the time i dont have a computer so i can loggin and just start playing. Thats where my ideé comes in. Insted of me loggin into a game where its requierd that i have a computer or other device i wanna be able to see in some other play whats happening in the game Im playing. And I'm also a owner over a discord server that have the main focus of playing games together. And i started to see the pattern of many people just loggin into a game to check what shop they have that day or if some event in the game has been realesed.
Personas and user stories

## Results from user stories

Have to be good to navigation. The website have to look good and be inspiering for people to play there games. Its important that the right information is on the website becoues that why they wisite it on the first place.

## Activity and time plan

I worked in sprints on a weekly basis where I made a trello board for the week and after created issuse's on github.
trello was more so i just big could see whats needed to be done and github was more split up into smaller issuse's.
And no everything didt go according to plan becoues alot of the coding stuff took longer time then expected.

the plan first was to write out patch notes for games. But i saw fast that this was not something wthat was included in the API's I'm using or and other API's that was easy exesiable. So i had to swap the plan from patch notes to other ingame relevant content.

I had a few Hiccups thats included the amount of work that i had to do to get out the results from the API's. Since it was really much information in the API's i had to narrow it down to what's good to see from my audiance.

### Technical evaluation

## Tech stack

- react vite
- typescript
- css

### npm packages

- react-router-dom
- axios
- feather-icons

## Lessons Learned

- Making time to think over selutions before making them
- You can learn alot from your misstakes
- kod often takes longer time to write then I think
- Take a step back and try to look at the problem you have from another prespectiv.
- If i could do it again i would probbebly have done smaller github issuse's and worked with them insted of verry big issuse's

## Results

The result i got was a working website with 2 games and the games had content in them that would be relevant for a user. Also the game content is up to date since its taken from API's.
